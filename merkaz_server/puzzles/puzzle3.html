<h1>Part 3</h1>

You will receive a grid of numbers.

Each line represents a row in a matrix.

The numbers in each line are separated by commas.

The matrix may contain any non-negative integers.

Your task is to count how many numbers in the matrix are STRICTLY greater than all of their neighbors.

A neighbor is any adjacent cell in one of the following directions:
- Up
- Down
- Left
- Right
- Diagonal up-left
- Diagonal up-right
- Diagonal down-left
- Diagonal down-right

A number is considered valid only if it is greater than ALL of its existing neighbors.
Cells on the edges or corners have fewer neighbors and should be evaluated accordingly.

<h3>Example</h3>

Input matrix:
3,1,4
2,9,5
6,7,8

Valid numbers:
9 (greater than all its neighbors)

So the result will be : 1.

<h3>Output</h3>
A single number - the count of values in the matrix that are strictly greater than all of their neighbors.
